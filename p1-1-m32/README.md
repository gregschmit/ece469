# Project 1, Part 1 -- MIPS 32-bit ALU

To build the report PDF, you need:

 - `make` - Any POSIX system should have this, or in Windows you can use git-bash, or cygwin, or some other utility to fix your broken operating system
 - `pdflatex` - you can get this by installing TeX Live or MiKTeX

To build the report:

```sh
$ make pdf
```
