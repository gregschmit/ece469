part1: SQM
This part of the project took a negligible amount of time.
We learned that hdl has the power to reduce time needed to
implement arithmetic operations.

part2: CA2
This part took between 0.5 to 1 hour.
Very simple function, we implemented using muxes.

part3: output analysis / serial1s / s1s / consecutive ones counter
This part several hours (4-6) of brainstorming on one group 
member's part. However, another group member was familiar with this
problem and already had a basic idea of the implementation.
Estimated time of writing code and testing is less than 1.5 hours.

part4: Controlled Fault Injecter
This part took less than 0.5 hour of brainstorming to figure out.
Coding and testing took near 1.5 hours.
